# Physical Layer

The Physical Layer is the first and lowest layer of the OSI Model. It is responsible for the actual transmission of data as electrical, optical, or radio signals over a physical medium (like cables or wireless).

## Functions of the Physical Layer

1️⃣ Transmission of Raw Bits

Converts data (1s and 0s) into signals (electrical, optical, or radio) for transmission.
Example: When you send a WhatsApp message, your phone converts the message into signals to send it through Wi-Fi or mobile networks.

2️⃣ Defines Transmission Media

Decides which type of cables or wireless technology will be used.
Example: Ethernet cables (wired) or Wi-Fi (wireless) are used to transmit data.

3️⃣ Data Rate Control (Bit Rate)

Determines the speed (bandwidth) of data transmission (measured in Mbps or Gbps).
Example: A fiber-optic cable can transfer data faster than an old telephone cable.

4️⃣ Synchronization of Bits

Ensures that sender and receiver are in sync when sending and receiving data.
Example: Just like a TV remote and TV must be synchronized to work properly.

5️⃣ Transmission Modes
The Physical Layer decides how data flows between devices:\
Simplex → One-way communication (📻 Example: Radio broadcasting).\
Half-Duplex → Two-way communication, but only one at a time (🎤 Example: Walkie-talkie).\
Full-Duplex → Two-way communication at the same time (📞 Example: Phone call).\

6️⃣ Topology and Networking Devices

Defines how devices are connected (Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, etc.).\
Uses devices like hubs, repeaters, and modems.\
Example: In an office, computers may be connected using a star topology (all connected to a central switch).

### Examples of Physical Layer in Daily Life

📡 Wi-Fi Signals – Your phone sends data through radio waves to a router.
🔌 Ethernet Cable – Your computer connects to the internet through a LAN cable.
📶 Fiber Optic Cables – High-speed data transfer using light pulses.
📠 Modem & Telephone Lines – Converts digital data into analog signals and vice versa.
